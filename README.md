# COMBSS GLM

**COMBSS GLM** extends the original **COMBSS** framework to **generalized linear models (GLMs)**, providing tools for performing *combinatorial best-subset selection* across a wide range of likelihood-based models.

This repository builds on the methodology introduced in the original COMBSS project. In this implementation, we employ a Frank–Wolfe algorithm to handle box constraints, rather than unconstrained gradient descent, enabling efficient support for GLMs such as logistic regression, Poisson regression, and other exponential-family models.
